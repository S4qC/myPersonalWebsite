      <p>
       Hi, and thank you so much for visiting my page!
I’m QC, otherwise known as S4qC on the internet. I’m currently learning C++ and looking forward to learn more programming language. Along with coding, I’m a person who truly loves to share his ideas through the mean of writing. Most of the things I write are about tech, studies, and self-improvement, but I also like to share my thoughts on anything that inspires me.
I’m also someone who enjoys helping others whenever I get the chance—whether it’s with studies, tech, or just giving a bit of guidance from my own experiences. Writing, for me, is not just about expressing myself, but also about creating something that might benefit others.
I hope you will enjoy reading my <a href="https://s4qc.github.io/blogs.html" target="_blank">Blogs</a> and that will find them useful, relatable, and inspiring. After all, We are humans not horses.
